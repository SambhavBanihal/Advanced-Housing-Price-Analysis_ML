Project: Ames Housing — preprocessing & baseline modeling

FILES I HAVE NOW
- train.csv (raw original train with SalePrice)
- test.csv (raw original test without SalePrice)
- eda_on_train.ipynb (EDA on train)
- feature_eng_on_train.ipynb (feature engineering on train)
- eda_feature_engineering on test.ipynb (EDA + feature engineering on test)
- Feature selection.ipynb (feature selection on train)
- test train compare and linear regression model.ipynb (alignment of train/test and baseline Linear Regression)
- X_train_final.csv (processed + selected features for train, no SalePrice)
- X_test_final.csv (processed + selected features for test, aligned with train)

WHAT I DID
1. Performed EDA on train (eda_on_train.ipynb).
2. Did feature engineering on train (feature_eng_on_train.ipynb).
3. Did EDA + feature engineering on test (eda_feature_engineering on test.ipynb).
4. Carried out feature selection on train (Feature selection.ipynb).
5. Compared train and test processed sets; ran baseline Linear Regression (test train compare and linear regression model.ipynb).
6. Saved final processed CSVs (X_train_final.csv, X_test_final.csv).
7. Extracted y_train from raw train.csv.

WHAT I HAVE NOW
- Features (X_train_final, X_test_final) aligned and numeric-only.
- Target (y_train) available in notebook memory from raw train.csv.
- Multiple notebooks documenting each step of the pipeline.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS / NEXT STEPS
1. Train advanced models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
2. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, or Optuna).
3. Consider log-transforming SalePrice to improve RMSE.
4. Explore feature interactions (e.g., Neighborhood × OverallQual).
5. Package preprocessing into a Pipeline and save artifacts for reproducibility.
6. Evaluate models using cross-validation, not only one train/val split.
7. Perform residual analysis to spot systematic errors (e.g., by neighborhood).
8. Finalize model: train on full train set, predict on X_test_final, prepare submission.csv with Ids from raw test.csv.
